The provided code implements a Kalman filter to track a hidden variable, beta, utilizing NASDAQ close prices for the year 2008. The Kalman filter predicts the next value of beta based on current observations, incorporating both prediction and update steps. Additionally, it integrates a Monte Carlo simulation for a leading economic indicator (LEI) alongside an autoregressive (AR) process of the NASDAQ data. The AR process models the temporal dependencies in the data, while the Monte Carlo simulation enhances the predictive capabilities by simulating variations in the leading economic indicator. The code concludes by plotting the actual versus predicted NASDAQ closing values and separately visualizing the AR process and the Monte Carlo simulation for the LEI over time.
